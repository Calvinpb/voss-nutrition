                <p>It's not exactly considered an easy push for anyone to turn Vegan simply over night,
                    most people will opt for gradually replacing their source of Dairy products and Meat 
                    for subsidiesed alternatives such as Soy milk and Tofu.

            <br>
            <p>We can start off with animal products, as there are a great variety of alternatives out there
                which can provide the body it's neccessary nutrients it requires to function in an optimal state.
                Soy, Rice and Almond milk are all great places to start.
